\# META



This folder is the operating system for builtbyjesus.dev.



Rules:

\- If it ships, it gets a changelog entry.

\- If we decide something, it goes in DECISIONS.md.

\- If we work on something, STATUS.md reflects it.

\- Logbook entries are facts-first; neuron\_stretch is optional flavor.

\- Repo is the source of truth. Memory lives here, not in vibes.
